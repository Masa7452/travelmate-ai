## 1) Logging Policy

* Never log Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
* Logs must contain only non-sensitive, aggregated, or anonymized data.
* Ensure logs are rotated and access-controlled.

---

## 2) Data Storage

* Supabase Storage must use **private buckets** only.
* Public access must rely on **signed URLs** with expiration.
* Database rows must be protected with Row Level Security (RLS).

---

## 3) Authentication & Authorization

* For any user-context features, enforce:

  * `user_id = auth.uid()` in RLS policies.
  * Ownership validation before data access.
* API endpoints must validate identity before serving sensitive data.

---

## 4) Data Rights

* Provide endpoints to export user data.
* Provide endpoints to permanently delete user data.
* Respect GDPR/CCPA-equivalent user rights.

---

## 5) Secrets & Environment Variables

* Never commit secrets or API keys to the repository.
* Store secrets in environment variables managed by Vercel or a secrets manager.
* `.env.example` must list all required variables without values.

---

## 6) Secure Development Practices

* Keep dependencies up to date.
* Run `pnpm audit` regularly.
* Review third-party libraries for license and security.
* Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies.
